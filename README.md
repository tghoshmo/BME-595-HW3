# Comments
 * Hand crafted weights and the weights obtained from the trained network are not necessarilty identical. However they are more or less in the same proportion and produce similar results. 
 * Higher learning rate reduces the number of iterations required for convergence of gradient descent. However, too large learning rate will fail to converge. 
 * The optimum values of the weights could produce the target output values.
